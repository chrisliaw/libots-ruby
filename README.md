# Ots::Ruby

This repository is attempt to collect One Time Signature (OTS) scheme in a single library.

However currently only has the basic Lamport OTS is implemented.

For any interested party continue with Winternitz, Winternitz OTS+ (WOTS+)?

I benefit greatly for great blogger like [Matthew Green](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/04/07/hash-based-signatures-an-illustrated-primer/), [David Wong](https://cryptoservices.github.io/quantum/2015/12/04/one-time-signatures.html), [Zachary Ratliff](https://zacharyratliff.org/Lamport-Signatures/) to clear up the concept for me!
